# Onboarding summary

I collected and saved onboarding memories for this repository:

- project_overview.md: high-level purpose, tech stack, structure, key scripts
- suggested_commands.md: common development commands (install, dev, build, test, lint)
- style_conventions.md: TypeScript/ESLint/testing/style guidance
- task_completion.md: pre-PR checklist and commands to run

Development environment:
- OS: Linux
- Node: >=22.11
- Package manager: pnpm >=10

Next steps for new contributors:
1. Copy `.npmrc.org` to `.npmrc` and insert credentials if needed
2. pnpm install
3. pnpm dev to start watch + app-astro

Saved to memories for quick access.
