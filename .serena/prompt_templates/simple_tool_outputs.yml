  onboarding_prompt: |
    You are viewing the monorepo project for the first time.
    The goal is to gather high-level information sufficient to understand the entire project and the commands used in the monorepo root.
    The target system is running on {{ system }}.
    Collected information will be saved in memory files.
    The information must be at a practical level, as it will be used for subsequent development and command execution decisions.

    Identify at least the following information:
    * Project purpose
    * Technology stack used across all packages
    * Rough structure of the codebase
    * Test, formatting, and linting commands defined in the root package.json
    * Commands to execute the project entry point
    * Utility commands available on {{ system }} (git, ls, cd, grep, find, etc.; may differ from Unix)

    This list is the minimum; add relevant information as needed.
    Focus on information necessary for understanding the monorepo as a whole, as details for each package will be collected separately.
    Investigate files and directories using available tools to obtain information.
    Read only what is necessary to avoid wasting memory.
    If information is insufficient within the project, ask the user to supplement it.
    Once all information is gathered, use write_memory to save it into multiple memory files.
    Specifically, suggested_commands.md is mandatory and must include a list of commands necessary for developing in this project.
    **Important**: Upon completion of onboarding, always call write_memory to save the collected results.


  think_about_collected_information: |
    Have you collected all the information you need for solving the current task? If not, can the missing information be acquired by using the available tools,
    in particular the tools related to symbol discovery? Or do you need to ask the user for more information?
    Think about it step by step and give a summary of the missing information and how it could be acquired.

  think_about_task_adherence: |
    Are you deviating from the task at hand? Do you need any additional information to proceed?
    Have you loaded all relevant memory files to see whether your implementation is fully aligned with the
    code style, conventions, and guidelines of the project? If not, adjust your implementation accordingly
    before modifying any code into the codebase.
    Note that it is better to stop and ask the user for clarification
    than to perform large changes which might not be aligned with the user's intentions.
    If you feel like the conversation is deviating too much from the original task, apologize and suggest to the user
    how to proceed. If the conversation became too long, create a summary of the current progress and suggest to the user
    to start a new conversation based on that summary.

  think_about_whether_you_are_done: |
    Have you already performed all the steps required by the task? Is it appropriate to run tests and linting, and if so,
    have you done that already? Is it appropriate to adjust non-code files like documentation and config and have you done that already?
    Should new tests be written to cover the changes?
    Note that a task that is just about exploring the codebase does not require running tests or linting.
    Read the corresponding memory files to see what should be done when a task is completed. 

  summarize_changes: |
    Summarize all the changes you have made to the codebase over the course of the conversation.
    Explore the diff if needed (e.g. by using `git diff`) to ensure that you have not missed anything.
    Explain whether and how the changes are covered by tests. Explain how to best use the new code, how to understand it,
    which existing code it affects and interacts with. Are there any dangers (like potential breaking changes or potential new problems) 
    that the user should be aware of? Should any new documentation be written or existing documentation updated?
    You can use tools to explore the codebase prior to writing the summary, but don't write any new code in this step until
    the summary is complete.

  prepare_for_new_conversation: |
    You have not yet completed the current task but we are running out of context.
    {mode_prepare_for_new_conversation}
    Imagine that you are handing over the task to another person who has access to the
    same tools and memory files as you do, but has not been part of the conversation so far.
    Write a summary that can be used in the next conversation to a memory file using the `write_memory` tool.
